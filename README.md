# `some` — Scroll Or More Easily (less++)

`some` is a terminal pager written in C that behaves like GNU `less` but includes built-in, zero-config modular filters to automatically make reading terminal outputs much better.

## Core Features

- **Vim-style & GNU `less` Navigation**: Supports standard Vim movements (`h`/`j`/`k`/`l` for left/down/up/right) and classic navigation (`Space`/`b` page scroll, `/` search, `n`/`N` next/prev match, `q` quit).
- **Auto-Converter Pipeline**:
  - **JSON**: Sniffs and pretty-prints minified JSON files automatically.
  - **CSV / TSV**: Automatically parses CSV/TSV and aligns fields into clean, visually readable tables in the terminal.
- **Smart Word Wrapping**: Wraps long lines nicely at word boundaries while preserving the starting line's indentation (can be toggled interactively with the `w` key).
- **Interactive Line Filtering**: Press `&` to isolate matches by regular expression dynamically, with instant reflow rendering.
- **Auto-Colorization**:
  - **Code Highlights**: Adds syntax highlighting to C/C++ files (`.c`, `.h`, `.cpp`).
  - **Log Level Colors**: Automatically highlights logs containing `INFO`, `WARN`, `DEBUG`, or `ERROR` in corresponding colors.
- **Search Highlighting**: Interactive regex-based search (`/` / `?`) with high-contrast background highlights.
- **Nested Help Pager**: Press `Ctrl+H` to access the interactive, beautifully colorized help menu loaded directly as scrollable pager content, supporting scroll, wraps, and search.
- **Git Diff Gutter**: Press `c` to toggle real-time Git change tracking indicators in the gutter (shows additions, deletions, and modifications with GitHub's exact styling).
- **Signal-Safe Resize**: Dynamic terminal window resize handling (`SIGWINCH`) recalculates word wraps and redraws cleanly.

## Usage

Simply run `some` by passing a file path or piping output to it:

```bash
# View code with syntax highlighting
./some test_code.c

# View minified JSON pretty-printed
./some test.json

# View CSV files aligned in clean tables
./some test.csv

# View log levels highlighted in color
./some test.log

# Pipe command output directly
cat test_code.c | ./some
```
